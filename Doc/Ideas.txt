Each frame, each Shader drops all the uniforms it has snapped, and subsequent
SnapUniforms() calls build up the Uniforms[] list again within that shader. 
Many times, the new uniforms will match exactly what already existed there, so
this is wasted effort. 

Instead: suppose the set of uniforms for a Shader is an IdxHeap[]. Then, we
need not flush the Uniforms[] list of the shader at the start of every frame.
When an RBatch is retired, it will release its uniform back into the heap. 
And when an RBatch is _recolored_ (fresh uniforms), we can reuse the same
slot in the IdxHeap to store those new uniforms.

The advantage is that if there are large subtrees where no recoloring is needed,
we can even avoid doing this re-Snapping of the uniforms, since we can just
use the old one that already exists in the Shader's uniforms IdxHeap. 

The uniforms need to be re-snapped only for VNode that have their AttributesDirty
bit set (and the entire subtree underneath that, because of attribute propagation). 
So we could pass in a flag into the Render routine, which could get ORed with the
AttributesDirty at each stage so subtrees of VNodes with AttributesDirty will
have their uniforms re-gathered again.
